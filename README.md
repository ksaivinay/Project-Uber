# Project-Uber

In this project I took uber dataset of newyork city for data analysis. Anaconda software was used. I used data visualization libraries like matplotlib, plotly, folium and seaborn in jupyter notebook. Visualization graphs like  bar charts, lineplots, pointplots, heatmaps, subplots and histograms were used to form meaningful visualizations. Folium library is used for geo-spatial analysis of the uber data in newyork city. I have formulated many questions from the dataset and visualized the data in order to answer those questions. I am attaching my code as well. Anyone can go through my codes here. I am dropping the dataset as well in compressed format as it is a huge dataset.
